## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Background image styling is limited. Think about CSS while doing your HTML. 


### Continued development

- Check out all mobile sizes and tweak.  The background image curve is too low. Why is there a different background design for mobile when it's indistinguishable?
